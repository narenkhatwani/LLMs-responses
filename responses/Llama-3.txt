Developing a formula for the utility of a new concept relative to an existing ontology involves considering several factors that reflect the concept's potential impact, relevance, and integration with the existing knowledge structure. Here's a proposed outline for such a formula, which we can denote as Utility(U) of the new concept. This formula would be a function of several key factors:

1. **Relevance (R)**: How closely related is the new concept to the existing concepts within the ontology? This can be measured by the semantic similarity between the new concept and the concepts already in the ontology.

2. **Information Gain (IG)**: What new information or insights does the new concept bring to the ontology? This could be quantified by comparing the information entropy before and after the introduction of the new concept.

3. **Connectivity (C)**: How well does the new concept connect with existing concepts? This can be measured by the number of new relationships (e.g., hierarchies, associations) it establishes with existing concepts.

4. **Consistency (S)**: How consistent is the new concept with the existing structure and semantics of the ontology? This involves checking for potential contradictions or conflicts.

5. **Coverage (V)**: Does the new concept help in covering gaps or areas not well-represented in the current ontology? This could involve assessing the concept's ability to explain phenomena or concepts not currently addressed.

6. **Complexity Reduction (CR)**: Does the introduction of the new concept simplify the ontology by reducing redundancy, clarifying ambiguous concepts, or providing a more straightforward explanation for certain phenomena?

Given these factors, a simple, initial formulation for the Utility (U) of a new concept could look something like this:

U = (w1 * R + w2 * IG + w3 * C + w4 * S + w5 * V + w6 * CR) / (w1 + w2 + w3 + w4 + w5 + w6)

Where w1 through w6 are weights assigned to each factor based on their relative importance in the context of the ontology. These weights would need to be determined based on the specific goals and priorities of the ontology.

For example, if the primary goal is to expand the ontology's explanatory power without compromising its consistency, you might assign higher weights to Information Gain (IG) and Consistency (S).

It's also worth considering a threshold value (T) for the utility, below which the new concept would not be considered useful enough for insertion into the ontology. This threshold would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the ontology development project.

U >= T

This formula provides a basic framework. The actual implementation would require operationalizing each of the factors (e.g., using specific algorithms for semantic similarity, information gain, etc.) and determining the appropriate weights and threshold values based on the project's objectives and the ontology's characteristics.
